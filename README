obs-autosubmit
==============

obs-autosubmit is a tool to automatically submit changes in devel projects of
an Open Build Service to the main project.

While it has been designed (and tested) for the openSUSE:Factory project in the
build.opensuse.org OBS server, it can work on any Open Build Service server,
with any main project.


Usage
=====

Just run obs-autosubmit! It will read ~/.oscrc to know the credentials to use
for the OBS server.

obs-autosubmit will output some files, including a cache (that is important) in
the current directory, or in the directory specified with the --cache-dir
option.

The --apiurl and --project options can be used to specify which OBS server
and main project to use.

The --verbose option is useful in order to watch what obs-autosubmit is
deciding,


Disabling autosubmit behavior for a project or a package
========================================================

It's possible to disable the autosubmit behavior for a project or a package via
the openSUSE:DisableAutoSubmit attribute, if it set to true or 1.

This can be achieved with osc:

 osc meta attribute PROJECT [PACKAGE] --attribute openSUSE:DisableAutoSubmit --set true


Dependencies
============

obs-autosubmit depends on python and osc.
