obs-autosubmit
==============

obs-autosubmit is a tool to automatically submit changes in devel projects of
an Open Build Service to the main project.

While it has been designed (and tested) for the openSUSE:Factory project in the
build.opensuse.org OBS server, it can work on any Open Build Service server,
with any main project.


Usage
=====

Just run obs-autosubmit! It will read ~/.oscrc to know the credentials to use
for the OBS server.

obs-autosubmit will output some files, including a cache (that is important) in
the current directory, or in the directory specified with the --cache-dir
option.

The --apiurl and --project options can be used to specify which OBS server
and main project to use.

The --verbose option is useful in order to watch what obs-autosubmit is
deciding,

To protect against running this tool twice at the same time (which would be
expensive in terms of interaction with the OBS server), obs-autosubmit has some
(very basic) lock mechanism. In case obs-autosubmit is locked with no reason,
just remove the file "running" from the cache directory.


Dependencies
============

obs-autosubmit depends on python and osc.
